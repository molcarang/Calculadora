# Calculadora Project

## Overview
The Calculadora project consists of two main components: a simple calculator and a basic banking system. The calculator provides a menu-driven interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, while the banking system allows for account management functionalities.

## Files

### 1. Calculadora.java
This file contains the implementation of the `Calculadora` class, which provides methods for the following arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponentiation
- Square Root

The class features a user-friendly menu interface that allows users to select operations and input numbers.

### 2. BankingSystem.java
This file will implement a basic banking system. It will define various account statuses and functionalities, including:
- Creating accounts
- Depositing funds
- Withdrawing funds
- Checking account balances
